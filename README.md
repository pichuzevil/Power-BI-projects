Two of mine BI projects:
I've used Power BI to analyse free datasets and create dashboards to illustrate interesting statistics.

Project 1 is about car casualties in the UK and its growth over a year (2021-2022).

Project 2 is about a professional survey. 

You can download the .pbix file to see the final dashboards.

(.pdf files allows you to look at a picture of the dashboards).
